# Reflection on LLM Use

I used ChatGPT to generate an initial outline and sample content for my MBA portfolio webpage. The LLM helped me structure the page into clear sections such as About Me, Education, Professional Experience, and Skills.

I revised the content extensively to ensure accuracy and authenticity. Generic statements were removed and replaced with details from my real academic background and work experience. The final portfolio reflects my own voice, skills, and career goals. The LLM was used only as a brainstorming and drafting aid.
The process of editing the LLM-generated content allowed me to critically evaluate what information was most relevant and how to best present myself to potential employers. Overall, the LLM provided a helpful starting point, but the final product is entirely my own work.
